# YOLOv4-facemask-detection
Hi, my name is Eric Chien and I am a software Engineer! When it was a junior in college my team and I developed a facemask detection Object Recognition model
during the peak of COVID-19. In this repository I share with you guys our research and what we did to create it. Unfortunately, the source code is too huge and our dataset
is huge I cannot upload on here. But fret not, I have some google collab files that you guys can look at and the video actively working! 

Below is a link that shows our final model working : <a href:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-0PAXTX9xCOMF1YPZNaqnLdS9FhY2IcQ/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank">Final Project Results</a>
